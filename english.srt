1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,290
Major Sirius...

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,490
As of this moment,

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,160
I order you to temporarily suspend pursuit
and elimination of the deserters,

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,330
and return to your original mission.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,450
Make the securing of the spell that caused
Scorched Halloween or its user your top priority.

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,240
If securing is impossible,
you will need to eliminate the caster.

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,040
That's...

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,580
The Brionac.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,580
Headquarters has given you
permission to use it.

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,790
For now, assume
that Tatsuya Shiba is your target.

11
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,330
Tomorrow night, you'll take the Stardust
members and launch an attack on the target.

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,700
You are to equip the Brionac and
intervene when you judge it necessary.

13
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,990
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,580
FEBRUARY 15, 2096

15
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,240
"ROBOT"

16
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,740
Oh, Shiba!

17
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,700
Is it true that Pixie
has emitted magical energy?

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,790
Yes. We detected traces
of high-density Psions from the P94's body.

19
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,870
They were emitted
from inside the chest area.

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,910
Pixie's chest region is where its
electronic brain and containment vessels

21
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,450
for fuel cells are, right?

22
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,740
Which one did it come from?

23
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,410
It was from close to the electronic brain.

24
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,330
Seriously, this is too much.

25
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,660
And we saw traces of Pushions, too.

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,990
Would you tell me what happened?

27
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,240
The incident started
exactly at seven this morning.

28
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,740
As usual, after Pixie's
self-diagnostic program ended,

29
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,240
it should've gone into suspend mode.

30
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,540
Access school student records.

31
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,580
But, this morning,
Pixie's functions did not cease...

32
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,200
and it accessed First High Schools' server.

33
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,490
Wasn't the forced shutdown
command transmitted?

34
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,580
It was, for sure.

35
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,700
The command was executed
inside Pixie's electronic brain.

36
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
But...

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,740
Reboot.

38
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,040
Requesting access
to school student records.

39
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,870
Request access again.

40
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,830
In the end, Pixie continued to access
the school's student records...

41
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,910
until the server shut down the system.

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,580
It was smiling the whole time.

43
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,910
Its expression was kind of excited.

44
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,540
Like it was eager about something.

45
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,290
I understand.

46
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,580
I'll take a look.

47
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,910
Pixie, cancel suspend mode.

48
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
What do you require?

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,700
Lie down face-up on that stand
and move into inspection mode.

50
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,740
I found you.

51
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,160
Shiba is even popular with robots.

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,790
I was not aware you had a hobby
of playing with dolls, Brother.

53
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,410
I wasn't the one who hugged her here.

54
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,990
She hugged me.

55
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,370
With your physical skills, Brother,
it should've been quite easy to dodge!

56
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,410
If I had dodged,
it would've hit you, wouldn't it?

57
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,790
I-I'm terribly sorry for my rudeness.

58
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,490
M-More importantly,
we need to do something about Pixie.

59
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,080
Pixie, move.

60
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,870
Sit on that table.

61
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,290
At once.

62
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,700
Mizuki...

63
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,370
Yes?

64
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,040
Take a look inside Pixie.

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,950
Mikihiko, I want you to be on guard
so she doesn't suffer any major injury.

66
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,160
You think Pixie is possessed by something?

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,450
That's right.

68
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,870
It's there!

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,080
The parasite!

70
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,160
But this pattern is...

71
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,330
What?

72
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,540
This pattern...
It's just like Honoka's.

73
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,660
What does that mean?

74
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,200
The parasite is under the influence
of Honoka's thought waves.

75
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,330
Um, does that mean
she's controlling it?

76
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,660
No, I don't believe
it's that sort of connection.

77
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,080
It's more like, the parasite
is copying Honoka's thoughts.

78
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,330
Or maybe I should say that Honoka's feelings
have been burned into the parasite.

79
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,200
I didn't do anything like that!

80
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,160
She's not saying you did it on purpose.

81
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,330
Right, Mizuki?

82
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,120
Yes. It's not conscious.
They're more like residual thoughts.

83
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,990
That is correct.

84
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:55,200
I awakened to especially
strong feelings toward him.

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,160
Active telepathy?

86
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,080
The residual Psions must've actually
been psychic power, not magic.

87
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,620
Can you communicate through speech?

88
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,370
I am able to understand speech.

89
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,790
However, it is difficult to control
this body's vocal organs...

90
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,200
so please allow me to use telepathy
in order to communicate my intent.

91
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,660
A robot is smiling.
B-Because of Honoka? Psy-Psy-Psychic?

92
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,700
You seem to be communicating
in our language quite well.

93
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,660
How did you learn it?

94
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,160
I have inherited
the knowledge of my previous host.

95
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,200
Then, are you the parasite from before?

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,950
Parasite. An organism that feeds off
another organism. Yes, we are similar to that.

97
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,540
How many people
have you sacrificed thus far?

98
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,450
How many?
I cannot answer that question.

99
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,740
I do not remember.

100
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,240
So many that you don't remember
the exact number?

101
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,830
That is incorrect.

102
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,160
The only thing we can inherit
when shifting host bodies

103
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,410
is the knowledge detached
from the host's personality.

104
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,200
We lose all memories linked
to their personality upon moving.

105
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,870
I see. That means you don't know
what kind of person your previous host was.

106
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,080
And you don't remember whether
there was one, two or more of them.

107
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
That is correct.

108
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,660
Your understanding is accurate.

109
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,950
So, you can offer your own impressions
in addition to answering questions.

110
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,490
Do all of you have emotions, as well?

111
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,040
We, too, possess a desire
for self-preservation.

112
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,200
You mean to say you possess likes and dislikes,

113
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,160
originating in deciding
whether things are beneficial

114
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
or detrimental to self-preservation?

115
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
That is correct.

116
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,160
What should we call you?

117
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,660
We have no name,

118
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,580
so please call this individual
by its nickname, "Pixie."

119
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,410
Then, Pixie...

120
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,620
Are you our enemy?

121
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,370
I am subordinate to you.

122
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,490
To me? Why?

123
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,540
I want to be yours.

124
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,290
I awoke from my resting state because of
the individual named Honoka Mitsui's thoughts.

125
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,290
We are drawn to strong
and highly pure thoughts,

126
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,490
and we form our ego
using those thoughts as a core.

127
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,160
Highly pure...

128
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,950
Do you mean thoughts rooted in single desires?

129
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,490
That is correct.

130
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,740
I believe that, in your language,

131
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,910
the concept of prayer would be closest.

132
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,040
I want to do everything for you.

133
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,740
I want to be useful to you.

134
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,950
I want to serve you.

135
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,200
I want to be yours.

136
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,410
I want to offer everything to you.

137
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,700
That is the prayer that awoke me.

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,790
And right now, the desire
to become yours makes up my core.

139
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,540
Therefore, I am subordinate to you.

140
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,990
I'm surprised you all have an ego,

141
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,200
and even more so that you're
all entirely passive beings.

142
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,700
In other words, you didn't come to
this world because you wished to. Correct?

143
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,330
We originally are simple beings that exist.

144
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,160
We are given wishes by our host.

145
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,240
That hits close to home.

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,620
Anyway, am I correct in saying
you will follow my instructions?

147
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,580
That is my wish.

148
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,290
Then, you will obey my orders.

149
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,580
I hereby forbid you to use psychic powers
without my permission.

150
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,160
You're using a sort of telekinesis
to change your expression, too, right?

151
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,240
None of that, either.

152
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,950
As you command.

153
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,040
I'd never even suspected
the monster could possess a robot.

154
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,200
It's probably because
it was a humanoid type.

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
What an unlikely tsukumogami .

156
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,990
You have piano and etiquette
lessons today, don't you?

157
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,830
Yes.

158
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,580
Then, I'll come pick you up
when it's over like usual.

159
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,040
Yes. I will be waiting for you.

160
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,830
Five of them...

161
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,120
And they're...

162
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,540
surveillance from another faction?

163
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,330
Everyone is in position.

164
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,870
Major Sirius...

165
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,370
The Stardust unit is in place.
What is your situation?

166
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,490
Ready to deploy.

167
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,450
Good. First, the Stardust unit
will attempt to capture the target.

168
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,080
If that proves impossible, they will lure him
to the park where you're waiting.

169
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,450
After that, I will leave it
to your judgment.

170
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,990
Roger that.

171
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,790
Then, begin the operation!

172
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,450
What? The spell bounced back!

173
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,200
An engineered magician...
No, an enhanced human?

174
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,950
Enhanced beyond their physical capacity.

175
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,240
At this rate, I bet they've got
only a handful of years to live.

176
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,870
A true suicide squad.

177
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,080
VISITOR ARC VII

178
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,870
That spell...

179
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,200
No doubt about it.

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,040
That was Strategic-Class magic,
Heavy Metal Burst.

181
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,830
The target has begun
following Major Sirius.

182
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,700
Why did Major Sirius decide
to leave her position?

183
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,370
And to fire the Brionac
in the middle of traffic...

184
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,870
Summon the relay vehicle!

185
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,120
Yes, ma'am!

186
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,490
She canceled her camouflage.

187
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,410
To focus her mind on this attack spell?

188
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,740
Tatsuya...

189
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,870
You'd better surrender.

190
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,870
I don't know how you disable magic,

191
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,450
but you won't be able
to mess with the Brionac!

192
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,700
I see.

193
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,790
No time!

194
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,290
The Brionac...

195
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,240
That which pierces. The Brionac.

196
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,540
One of the weapons
the Celtic god of light Lugh possessed.

197
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,160
Does that naming mean...

198
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,660
you've reproduced the mythical weapon?

199
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,080
Tatsuya!

200
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll say it again.

201
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,370
Surrender!

202
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,950
You can't use your martial arts
with only one arm!

203
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,910
You have no chance of defeating me now!

204
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,620
What would you do with me
as your prisoner?

205
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,370
Human experimentation?

206
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,410
Like you did with them?

207
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,410
It doesn't really need to be said,
but I refuse to be your guinea pig.

208
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,740
Then...

209
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,450
I'll incapacitate you
and drag you away with me!

210
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,330
Your arm...

211
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,950
How?

212
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,790
Lina...

213
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,910
You'd be better off
quitting the army as soon as you can.

214
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,410
For a soldier, you're too naïve.

215
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,950
Or rather, you're too soft.

216
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,490
Sirius, commander of the Stars...

217
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,990
I really don't think you're fit for this job.

218
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,370
Oh, hello, Mr. Tatsuya.

219
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,950
What's the matter?

220
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,330
I'm sorry for calling so late, Mr. Hayama.

221
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,200
Actually, I just came under attack
by a small USNA military force.

222
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
Oh...

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
After fighting off their first wave,

224
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,990
I engaged in combat with the Stars commander,
Angie Sirius, and defeated her, too.

225
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,040
Then, I took down the backup team,

226
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,950
backed up the data they'd recorded,
and then erased everything they'd left.

227
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,410
Next, I repaired Sirius's wounds...

228
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,740
and erased all signs that we'd fought.

229
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,290
While making contact with the first wave,

230
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,450
I noticed other observers,
not with the USNA army.

231
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,540
They must have been Section Three.

232
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,160
Section Three...

233
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,700
Then, that unit was under
the Saegusa Family's yoke.

234
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,660
Yes. Mr. Koichi, the current leader of
the Saegusa Family, seems to be interested.

235
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,240
I expect he is investigating the parasites...
or more likely, is trying to capture one.

236
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,040
What a pain.

237
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,830
We will do something about
the USNA military for the time being.

238
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,120
Please send the backed up data here.

239
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Without an excuse to make
Section Three take action,

240
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,950
Mr. Koichi should back out
for the time being, as well.

241
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,580
Thank you.

242
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,910
Is something wrong?

243
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,540
No.

244
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,080
Nothing.

245
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,990
Brother...

246
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,620
You aren't hurt, are you?

247
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,080
Miyuki, calm down a little.

248
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,830
I shall not calm down! This blood...

249
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,910
You fought with Lina, didn't you?
And it wasn't one-on-one, either, was it?

250
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,120
Please just stay calm.

251
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,830
You know that nobody can leave injuries
on me if I don't let them, right?

252
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm terribly sorry, Brother.

253
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,080
That was shameful of me.

254
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,330
Not at all. I'm sorry for worrying you.

255
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,620
No, that's not... It's natural for
a sister to worry about her brother!

256
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm aware that no matter how many times
Lina challenges you, she can't defeat you.

257
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,660
Nobody can defeat you,
though you may search the entire world.

258
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,120
I wouldn't lose to anyone.

259
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,490
Not with you waiting for me.

260
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,910
Where am I?

261
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,580
Nobody's here?

262
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,580
Why?

263
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,080
No injuries...

264
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,120
No pain?

265
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,790
What's going on?

266
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,990
No.

267
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,580
Exotype magic...

268
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,990
A mental attack?

269
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,120
Have we been misunderstanding
something really important?

270
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,660
What if Tatsuya isn't a Mass-energy
Conversion Magic spell caster...

271
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,040
but a magician with a high aptitude
for Sensory Interference Magic?

272
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,620
An illusion master?

273
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,290
Oh, right!

274
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,790
I have to report to the control room!

275
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,080
VISITOR ARC VIII
